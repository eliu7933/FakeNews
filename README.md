# FakeNews
An analysis to determine what factors such as words or authors could best predict what would constitute a fake news article. The files included in this project are the README.md file which give an overview of the project and necessary code files, a .gitignore file which tells github to ignore certain files, a test.csv and train.csv file which includes the fake news data, and a FakeNewsCleaning.R and a FakeNewsAnalysis.R file which performs the cleaning of the dataset as well as the prediction analysis.

Methods that were used in this analysis were feature engineering and target encoding to create a dataset that included the most commonly used words in the data's articles. The function tf_idf was used to determine these commonly used words.

Prediction modelling methods included glmboosting methods.
